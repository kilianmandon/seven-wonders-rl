# RL for 7 Wonders Duel (WIP)

This repo is an experimental playground for reinforcement learning agents in **7 Wonders Duel**.  
Main focus right now is an AlphaZero-style approach in [`alpha_zero/`](./alpha_zero).

The code is rough and work-in-progress â€” I mostly use this repo to sync code to cloud instances.
